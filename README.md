# React Carousel Demo Project

> This project demonstrates how to build a simple carousel in two different ways using React and Vite. It includes two implementations: one without any external libraries and the other using the `react-slick` library. The carousel allows you to cycle through a list of people with navigation buttons for manual control and also supports automatic sliding.
